web_runner.sh file may need permission in order to run. Look here
for reference: https://askubuntu.com/questions/409025/permission-denied-when-running-sh-scripts


This goes inside of rc.local if not already there:

sleep 15
/home/{ user }/Desktop/data_collection_webserver/web_runner.sh &
iwconfig wlan0 power off #turns off power saver
exit 0

credentials.py does NOT come with git repo and must be optained by other needs
